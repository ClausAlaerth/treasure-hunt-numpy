# Treasure Hunt with Numpy

Following my journey, relearning some things and shaking the rust off my roots, I've decided to make a simple project depicting a treasure hunt using only Numpy.

Using the directionals (w/a/s/d), the player can navigate through the array to find the treasure. The game wil end when it is found or if the player presses "q" to quit the game.

The player's score with increment with every step taken. As counter-intuitive as it seems, the lower the score, the better, as it means you found the treasure with fewer steps.

## Requirements

This script was created with Python ver. 3.12. Make sure to install **numpy**, as it was the only module used in this project.

## Endnote

As I've mentioned earlier, this was a simple project, it doesn't even have an interface. You're welcome to adapt and implement whatever you've got in your mind. Thank you for reading!
