# Hobby Project - Treasure Hunt with Numpy

Following my journey, relearning some things and shaking the rust off my roots, I've decided to make a simple project depicting a treasure hunt using only Numpy.

## Requirements

This script was concieved with Python ver. 3.12 in mind. Make sure to install **Numpy**, as it was the only module used in this project.

## Endnote

As I've mentioned earlier, this was a barebones project, it doesn't even have an interface. You're welcome to adapt and implement whatever you've got in your ingenious mind. The sky's the limit!
